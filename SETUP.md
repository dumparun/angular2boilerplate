#Development Environment

I like Eclipse and i use eclipse for development. The checked in Project can be imported from GIT directly as a Java Script Eclipse Project.

#Node NPM and GIT

#bower Installation

#gulp Installation

#npm install for rest of the dependancy

#Eclipse Project settings

#running Gulp From Eclipse
