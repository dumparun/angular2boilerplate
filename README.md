# angular2boilerplate
This is a boiler plate code for providing a jump start for projects using angular 2.0 JS.


# Why?
The difference between a tutorial/hello world application and a real project is that, the latter would have a lot of workflows, business cases, communication, security, exception handling, build, test cases and so on, while the former would only talk about each.
Based on how complex your project is and how your product/project manager wants to spent, the above modules will keep varying.
In most cases, the time spent by the team is to set up the project, finalize the pieces, and then putting up the puzzles together.

This project is intented to put those missing pieces together as time goes on, add more and more best practices in places.

Now, there is another selfish interest, which is for me to understand how this works together :)

# What is in?
Here i am trying to put up a flow together, which has bits and pieces which can be used for projects. 
In short, you will find code snippets, sometimes modules, which you can copy paste in
