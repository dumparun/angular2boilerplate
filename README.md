# angular2boilerplate
This is a boiler plate code for providing a jump start for projects using angular 2.0 JS.


# Why?
The difference between a tutorial/hello world application and a real project is that, the latter would have a lot of workflows, business cases, communication, security, exception handling, build, test cases and so on, while the former would only talk about each.
Based on how complex your project is and how your product/project manager wants to spent, the above modules will keep varying.
In most cases, the time spent by the team is to set up the project, finalize the pieces, and then putting up the puzzles together.

This project is intented to put those missing pieces together as time goes on, add more and more best practices in places.

Now, there is another selfish interest, which is for me to understand how this works together :)

# What is in?
Here i am trying to put up a flow together, which has bits and pieces which can be used for projects. 
In short, you will find code snippets, sometimes modules, which you can copy paste in 


# License Info

Now, let me be very clear about this:
If this piece of code, which i generally have copy pasted from various places, accidently (as i dont do anything intentionally) spills water on your keyboard, shows blue screen in windows, hangs your phone, destroys your data in your PC, informs your company about your bookmarks, shows your hidden files when you least expect it to, shows your porn history then dont blame me. Neither me or the code which i wrote is responsible for that.
More seriously, if this program accidently kills you, hacks into governments data, makes you decide to marry, make you cry thinking about the decision, electrocutes your from battery shock, drowns you in 100 ml whiskey then dont blame me. 

Now, this package uses certain libraries, frameworks which has its own licensing terms.
